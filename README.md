The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the phenomenon called Compton Scattering. This report goes into detail about the findings of energy and momentum conservation in photons, giving way for the discovery of photons behaving as wave-like particles. The experiment involves analyzing the scattering of high-energy photons (gamma rays) due to the interacts of electrons on a metallic target. By counting the amounts of photons scattered at different angles, ranging from 30 to 90\degree, the change in energy can be determined. Setting this change as a function of the angle, also for the calculation of the mass of an electron. In this report, the mass of an electron was determined to be $(7.967\pm 0.706)\cdot 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$, which is an 11\% error margin from the actual mass of an electron, being $9.1 \cdot 10^{-31} \text{ kg.}$
